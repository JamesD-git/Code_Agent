# Code Agent

This is a program that creates an AI coding assistant capable of generating, running, and debugging code based on voice instructions. The AI agent will perform the following tasks:

1. **Code Generation**: Given a voice instruction, the AI will generate the corresponding code using its natural language processing and code generation capabilities.

2. **Code Execution**: The generated code will be executed within a Docker container, providing a safe and isolated environment for testing and running the code.

3. **Debugging and Testing**: The AI will debug and test the generated code, ensuring its correctness and functionality.

## Features

- Voice-based interaction for providing instructions to the AI agent.
- Efficient code generation using state-of-the-art language models.
- Secure code execution within Docker containers.
- Automated debugging and testing of generated code.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run the Code Agent will be provided in the future updates.
